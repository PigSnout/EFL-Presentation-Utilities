## Purpose

The purpose of these tools are to help automate the formatting for certain posts you may make during an EFL Presentation. This will enable you to use fancier formatting for presentation posts while reducing the amount of time it would take to add the additional formatting. Even if you don't plan on using the other formatting tools, I would at least recommend running your Play By Play text through the Play By Play Format Fixer in order to make it more easily readable. For more information about the purposes of the individual tools, check their sections down below.

## How to Use

The sections below will describe the specifics for using each tool. Generally, you will fill in the inputs from each page and then you will click the Generate Output button to receive the output that you can use on the EFL forum. For the Play By Play Format Fixer, the output will be given as regular text. For the other tools, the output will be given as formatted HTML code. In order to use this, you can copy the code from the Output box, then go to the EFL forum where you want to make your post. You can then click the button that says Source (this should be in the top left of the new post input box, to the left of the bold icon) and then paste the code into the post and then click the Source button again. After this you should see the post properly formatted and from there you can use the regular post editing tools if you want to make any other modifications or else you can go ahead and post it. 

## Thread Creator

### Purpose

The Thread Creator allows you to create a formatted post that you can use when creating the thread for a presentation. The post will display all of the matchups and will list the expected time and the presenter.

### Inputs

- `League`: Specify which league the presentation is for. This will determine the game and team options that are provided below.
- `Season`: The numerical value of the current season.
- `Game`: The name of the game that is being presented. Either a week of the regular season or the name of a playoff game.
- `Date`: The date of the presentation. Defaults to the current date, but you can modify the written value or select a new date from the calendar.
- `Presenter`: The name of the presenter who is presenting the game.
- `Time`: The time when the game will be presented.
- `Number of Games`: The number of games for this presentation. The number of selections below will adjust when this value is updated.
- `Away Team #X`: The away team for game #X
- `Home Team #X`: The home team for game #X
- `Game of the Week Away Team`: The away team for the Game of the Week
- `Game of the Week Home Team`: The home team for the Game of the Week

### How to Use

Fill in each of the inputs with the value specified above and then click Generate Output. Copy the output from the Output box. Go to the EFL Gameday or ECFA Gameday section on the forum depending on which league you are presenting for and click Start new topic. Click the Source button and paste the output that you copied earlier into the post and then click the Source button again to see the formatted version of the post. You can copy the first line of text and use that as the thread title. You may also want to edit the presenter name to be in @[username] format so that it links to your profile (This part could not be automated because the link to the profile includes a number as well and the code wouldn't be able to determine this number just by having the username). Once you are satisfied, you can click Submit Topic to create the topic.

## Play By Play Format Fixer

### Purpose

There are several formatting issues present in the Play By Plays that are generated by the sim engine and this tool will clean up the Play By Play by fixing these issues. The main issue this resolves is that the Play By Play does not include spaces in several places where it should have spaces which can make it less easily readable. For example, the text generated by the Play by Play may include a line like this: 
```
6:204th and 3SEA - 724 yard FG by Leonidas, K. is good.
```
When with proper spacing it should look like this: 
```
6:20 4th and 3 SEA - 7 24 yard FG by Leonidas, K. is good.
```

This tool will go through and fix the spacing in every line of the Play By Play. 

The other issue resolved here is that the Play By Play displays incorrect timestamps at certain points when clock stoppages occur, such as a timeout, a spike, or a turnover on downs. This issue is because the timestamps on the Play By Play correspond to the time on the clock at the start of the play. However, the timestamp on the three mentioned moments will correspond to the play before the clock stoppage. But this is not correct because it is showing the time on the clock when the play starts and not the time on the clock after the play completes and the clock is stopped. Here is an example with a timeout.

```
2:122nd and 7SEA - 34Pass by Marteau, T., complete to Kavanagh, J. for 5 yds. Tackle by Hakora, R..
2:123rd and 2SEA - 39Seattle Predators : Timeout
1:513rd and 2SEA - 39Pass by Marteau, T., complete to Fourside, T. for -2 yds. Tackle by Backer, J..
```

In this example, it shows that there is 2:12 remaining on the clock when the timeout was called. However, this is incorrect because 2:12 is the amount of time that was on the clock when the 2nd down play started which would imply that no time passed during the play. And then there is 1:51 on the clock when the 3rd down starts, which makes it look like 21 seconds disappeared during the timeout. The reality is that 1:51 is the amount of time left on the clock at the end of the 2nd down play because this is the time left on the clock at the start of the 3rd down play after the timeout. So there was actually 1:51 on the clock when the timeout was called and that is the time value that should be reflected in the Play By Play. This inconsistency in the Play By Play can make late game clock management situations confusing for viewers due to inaccurate timestamps. This tool will resolve this error by taking timeouts, spikes, and turnovers on downs and replacing the timestamp with the timestamp from the following line so that it will correctly reflect the amount of time that was left when the clock stopped. For instance, the previous example would now become:

```
2:12 2nd and 7 SEA - 34 Pass by Marteau, T., complete to Kavanagh, J. for 5 yds. Tackle by Hakora, R..
1:51 3rd and 2 SEA - 39 Seattle Predators : Timeout
1:51 3rd and 2 SEA - 39 Pass by Marteau, T., complete to Fourside, T. for -2 yds. Tackle by Backer, J..
```

Running the Play By Play through this tool will fix some of these common formatting issues in the Play By Play, which should make it a little easier for viewers to follow during the game.

### Inputs

- `Original Text`: The original text of the Play By Play.

### How to Use

Once you receive the Play By Play from the simmer, you can copy the entire text of the Play By Play from the forum and paste it into the Original Text box on this page and click Generate Output. (Note that when copying between the forums and the Original Text box, you may see extra blank lines added between the lines of the Play By Play. This is not an issue as the code will remove the blank lines before giving you your output.) Now you can copy the corrected version of the Play By Play from the Updated Text box. Note that unlike with the other tools, the output here is not HTML code but rather is the regular text version of the corrected version of the Play By Play. So you can handle it the same way you would normally handle the text of the Play By Play. Personally, what I like to do is send myself a message on the forum and paste the text of the Play By Play in there. That way I have the correct version of the Play By Play saved on the forum and can easily copy individual drives from there when creating the posts for the individual drives and it gives me a place on the forum where I can send the formatted versions of the post to myself first in order to see what the fully formatted version looks like before posting it in the game thread.
